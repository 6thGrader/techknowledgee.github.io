Massive lore dump ahead!

Hi! I'm Jacek (jat͡sɛk It's a Polish name). I am currently in Year 6 (the final year of primary school), Term 3 of Week 9 in 2023, and live in Eastern Australia.
This was made as a part of our Inquiry project for this terms "Start Something That Matters" thing. It's basically where you create a not-for-profit business from the ground up
with avatars, ads, posters, jingles, Shark Tank presentations, and a expo on week 10 (all of which are supposed to be made on the Crappy Chromebooks or Ipads)  where the students parents (and hopefully yours) get to see your idea at a stand at the expo.
I did almost all of the work at home, I was the only one running the business btw. And the companys were all supposed to have 2-4 members doing different parts of the project
to decrease workload and crunch. The website was supposed to be made during the final weeks as a teeny portion of our project but i started work on the website
on like week 1 and built my whole business around the website as more thing had to be done. And I finished my ad in like 1 afternoon.
It was also my first ever time actually programming something that was decent and
got finished in the end. With my only assistance being learning pages from W3 Schools. Special thanks to them.
Anyways, enough boasting.
School is really fun! It's probably a bjillion times better than the American education system (at least if those videos shitting on how school and university are "bad" are true)
I actually learn stuff that helps me and
And I almost never don't feel like actively wanting to go home the entire day. I'm quite silly (maybe a bit too much) and like to tell jokes (though they usually come from the internet)
